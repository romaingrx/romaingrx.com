import { CategoryBadge, Goal } from './components';

I currently feel that I'm not the most effective at getting things done, consistently getting better at what I want and care about so I'd like to make a plan to methodically improve with 2 horizons/frequencies:

- _short term_ / _high frequency_: A plan based on daily, weekly and monthly base habits; easy to assess how well I execute it.
- _long term_ / _low frequency_: Long term goals that will dictate the direction to readjust the high frequency plan.

The goal is to have a support that doesn't take too much brain power, is easy to follow, assess and readjust as I go.

I thought of doing it publicly to be accountable and gather any feedback on the approach and share experiences if anyone is doing something similar (if that's the case, <CommentSection>please comment below</CommentSection>).

<Callout variant="note">
  I have a private version of this plan with a lot more details over the longer term goals and their
  rationales. I don't directly expose them in here but the following sections are some instrumental
  goals to help me tackle the bigger ones.
</Callout>

## Areas of improvement

I would like to improve in the following areas:

0. **Raw skills**: anything I would like to improve in terms of skills, knowledge, etc.
1. **Brain clarity / problem solving**: less brain fog and a crisper mental view
2. **Health**: mostly food, physical condition and sleep
3. **Time management**: being better at predicting how much time a task will take (ultimately will help packing more efficiently things in day)
4. **Social**: get better at making contacts, maintaining them and building a network

## Long term plan

<Callout>
  The long term plan should be reassessed every X month (TBD) by seeing how well I'm doing in the
  short term plan.
</Callout>

### 0. Raw skills

<Goal>
  - Will help grasp the world dynamics better (if I had infinite knowledge and skills I could have a
  crisper internal representation of how the world moves and changes) - Personal satisfaction -
  Improve in learning to learn
</Goal>

The following are my areas of intereset where I would like to improve

#### Hardware

I want to get a very clear understanding of how CPUs work, capable of writing assembly and reproduce a fully working CPU from scratch if needed. I believe it will help understand the accelerator and data types way better and will just help get a very clear intuition of how cycles work.
A good resource is [Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25691979-digital-design-and-computer-architecture-arm-edition) by Sarah L. Harris and David Money Harris. I started reading it but didn't go further than the `ALU` chapter.

Once I have a solid understanding of the good old von Neuman architecture, learn about accelerators (FPGA, GPU and TPU) and understand how they interact with the rest of the system. Explore [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) in the case of GPUs and [systolic arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array) for TPUs.

Then explore the software stack, what makes them good, their limitations and they work under the hood (big picture). Need to at leat explore [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/), [PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html), [XLA](https://openxla.org/xla), [Triton](https://triton-lang.org/) and [Pallas](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/index.html) (if I have a lot of energy, I can dig in [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)).

#### ML

There's a few things I would like to get more knowledgeable about:

- All ML architecures / approaches such as diffusion, all attention flavours, ...
- Distributed training and inference (clearly with a good intuition of how the hardware deals with it)
- End-to-end training with all the tips and tricks
- RL with a focus on [LLM based env]() and reward-model free approach
- Prob / stats with a focus on bayesian inference, markov chains, monte carlo, ...

<Hidden>
  ### 1. Brain clarity / problem solving
  <Goal>
    - Faster cycle from problem statement to hypothesis and problem solving - Time saving by pruning
    unecessaery hypothesis or non promising paths to explore - Train System 1 [@Kahneman2011] to get
    better at quick inference and intuition
  </Goal>
</Hidden>

### 1. Health

<Goal>
  - Long term preservation - Increase cognitive and physical capacities - Overall well-being
</Goal>

I believe that everything we are able to achieve as humans stems from good physical health; it is the foundation for all other accomplishments. As the common saying goes: **_mens sana in corpore sano._**

#### Diet

A recent analysis published in Nature Medicine, which examined data from over 100,000 participants across 30 years, highlights the significant impact of healthy dietary patterns on longevity and the preservation of mental, cognitive, and physical functions as individuals age [@Tessier2025].

<Callout variant="question" title="What makes a healthy diet?">
  The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) showed the strongest association with healthy aging so
  it seems that a healthy diet is composed of mixed sources but most importantly: - **High fiber
  intake** (30+ grams daily) from diverse sources. It seems to have a big impact on reducing
  colorectal, colon, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers [@gaesser2020whole] - **Omega-3
  rich foods** (fish, walnuts, flaxseeds) - **Antioxidant-rich plants** (fruits, vegetables, whole
  grains) - **Unsaturated fats** while limiting trans fats and excess sodium - **Moderate amounts of
  nutrient-dense animal products** (low-fat dairy, fish) - **Minimal sweetened and ultraprocessed
  foods**
</Callout>

#### Sport

The goal is to gain in physical condition and endurance as a whole, not just targetting for specific abilities or growing muscles.

Based on what I could find on WHOOP coach, here's a good week template to start with:

1. Cardio (Endurance & HIIT)
   - **2-3 sessions of moderate-intensity cardio** in hearth rate (HR) zones 2-3 (between XXX and YYY BPM). Each session between 30-60 minutes to buil the aerobic base and endurance.
   - **1 session of high intensity** in HR zones 4-5 (between XXX and YYY BPM) of around 15-30 minutes to boost VO<sub>2</sub> Max and power.
2. Strength training
   - **2-3 sessions** focused on full-body routines (squats, lunges, push/pull, ...) and rest at least a day between sessions for better muscle recovery.
3. Active recovery
   - **1-2 days of lower-intensity** activity such as yoga, stretching or light bike ride in HR zone 1.

#### Sleep

For the sleep schedule, I should focus on consistency and the amount I need. Again for this, WHOOP is doing a great job at providing the best estimate to how much to sleep and when to go to bed depending on the [day strain](https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/how-does-whoop-strain-work-101) and the general state of the body. It's gonna be to do better than them on predicting this.

### 2. Time management

<TODO hidden>
  - Logging everything I do to reflect on it - Give prediction before doing something - Some
  limitations on phone? (Not sure I need)
</TODO>

<Goal>
  - Spend time more effectively in relation to the greater goals; reduce small, compounding
  distractions. - Be in control of my time.
</Goal>

#### Logging everything I do to reflect on it

<Callout variant="question" title="How to do it properly?">
    Still have to figure out what's the best way to log everything easily. I have 2 approaches in mind.

    **0. Aggregate**

    Either aggregate data from different sources (phone, computer, wakatime, kindle, sport, etc.) but we need to find a way to extract the data easily.
    Sources:
    - **Screen time**: [Seems possible somehow to extract](https://gist.github.com/0xdevalias/38cfc92278f85ae89a46f0c156208fd5) everything
    - **Wakatime**: They have an [API](https://wakatime.com/developers)
    - **Kindle**: We have access to [a summary](https://www.amazon.com/kindle/reading/insights) of our reading so I guess it might be doable, the best would be to mount the Kindle and directly access the data but I couldn't manage to do so
    - **Sport**: At the moment I have a [WHOOP 5.0](https://www.whoop.com) and there's [a client in Go to interact with the API](https://github.com/karl-cardenas-coding/mywhoop) so I can access heart beats, stress, activities, ...

    The best would be to drop everything in a S3 bucket and build a visualization tool on top of it (most likely [Grafana](https://grafana.com))

    **1. Manual**

    Alternatively, I actively log everything in a well-structured manner and develop the habit to do so. [Toggl track](https://toggl.com/) could be an option, otherwise a simple [Notion database](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases).

</Callout>

It seems very important to have some data on how I spend my time to be able to reflect on it and improve. I don't need a very fine grained detail of what I do but at least the big categories and how they're linked to the greater goals (sport, reading, writing, social medias, ...)

#### Getting better at predictions

Once I determine precisely how my time is allocated, a natural way to accomplish more in a day is to predict how long a certain task will take. Coupled with the previous section, this allows me to have an overview of my day and be quite accurate about what I can achieve in a day, a week, ...

<Callout variant="question">Do I need hard constraints on my time allocation/management?</Callout>

### 3. Social

<TODO hidden>
  - Participate to all the events possible - Call people - Cold messaging - Online presence
</TODO>

<Goal>
  - More visibility - Build a bigger network [@Shirado2019] - Feel more connected to the world
</Goal>

Simply by being connected to the world, I feel more connected to myself and more motivated to achieve my goals. I'll participate to all the events possible that in relation to my interests.
I should as well call someone (family, friends, ...) at least every 2 days to keep the relationship alive. For the cold messaging, I should not be afraid of contacting people I admire to ask for advice or just discuss their work or projects; this could be once a week.

## Short term plan

Based on the long term goals, I'll setup a daily, weekly and monthly habit based plan.

| Habit                 | Frequency | Category                              | Notes                                         |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Read **1** book       | monthly   | <CategoryBadge category={"brain"} />  |                                               |
| Read **>10** minutes  | daily     | <CategoryBadge category={"brain"} />  |                                               |
| Write **2** blog post | monthly   | <CategoryBadge category={"social"} /> | One blog post is at least 500 words           |
| Write **2** notes     | weekly    | <CategoryBadge category={"social"} /> | One note is at least 100 words                |
| Do **3h** of sport    | weekly    | <CategoryBadge category={"health"} /> | with at least 25% in high intensity (>150bpm) |

**→ Will start this plan on October 1, 2025**
