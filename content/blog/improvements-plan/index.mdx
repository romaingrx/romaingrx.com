<TODO>

- Explain the areas of improvements, what I mean exactly
- Make the long term plan based on these areas
- Make the short term plan generic
- Make the current short term plan specific

</TODO>

I currently feel that I'm not the most effective at getting things done, consistently getting better at what I want and care about so I'd like to make a plan to methodically improve with 2 horizons/frequencies:
- *short term* / *high frequency*: A plan based on daily, weekly an monthly base habits; easy to assess how well I execute it.
- *long term* / *low frequency*: Long term goals that will dictate the direction to readjust the *high frequency* plan.


The goal is to have a support that doesn't take too much brain power, is easy to follow, assess and readjust as I go.

## Areas of improvement

I would like to improve in the following areas:

0. **Raw skills**: anything I would like to improve in terms of skills, knowledge, etc.
1. **Brain clarity / problem solving**: how to get the bigger picture more easily, how to
2. **Health**: mostly food, physical condition and sleep
3. **Time management**: being better at predicting how much time a task will take (ultimately will help packing more efficiently things in day)
4. **Social**: get better at making contacts and maintaining them

## Long term plan

<Callout>
The long term plan should be reassessed every X month (TBD) by seeing how well I'm doing in the short term plan.
</Callout>

### 0. Raw skills

<Goal>
- Will help grasp the world dynamics better (if I had infinite knowledge and skills I could have a crisper internal representation of how the world moves and changes)
- Personal satisfaction
- Improve in learning to learn
</Goal>

The following are my areas of intereset where I would like to improve

#### Hardware

I want to get a very clear understanding of how CPUs work, capable of writing assembly and reproduce a fully working CPU from scratch if needed. I believe it will help understand the accelerator and data types way better and will just help get a very clear intuition of how cycles work.
A good resource is [Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25691979-digital-design-and-computer-architecture-arm-edition) by Sarah L. Harris and David Money Harris. I started reading it but didn't go further than the `ALU` chapter.

Once I have a solid understanding of the good old von Neuman architecture, learn about accelerators (FPGA, GPU and TPU) and understand how they interact with the rest of the system. Explore [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) in the case of GPUs and [systolic arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array) for TPUs.

Then explore the software stack, what makes them good, their limitations and they work under the hood (big picture). Need to at leat explore [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/), [PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html), [XLA](https://openxla.org/xla), [Triton](https://triton-lang.org/) and [Pallas](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/index.html) (if I have a lot of energy, I can dig in [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)).

#### ML

There's a few things I would like to get more knowledgeable about:
- All ML architecures / approaches such as diffusion, all attention flavours, ...
- Distributed training and inference (clearly with a good intuition of how the hardware deals with it)
- End-to-end training with all the tips and tricks
- RL with a focus on [LLM based env]() and reward-model free approach
- Prob / stats with a focus on bayesian inference, markov chains, monte carlo, ...


### 1. Brain clarity / problem solving
<TODO>
    - find clear ways to get better
    - creatine
</TODO>

<Goal>
- Faster cycle from problem statetement to hypothesis and problem solving
- Time saving by pruning unecessaery hypothesis or non promising paths to explore
- Train System 1 [@Kahneman2011] to get better at quick inference and intuition
</Goal>

### 2. Health

<TODO>
    - Healthy food
    - Consistent sport with desired intensity distribution
    - Sleep schedule
</TODO>

<Goal>
- Long term preservation
- Increase cognitive and physical capacities
- ...
</Goal>

### 3. Time management

<TODO>
    - Logging everything I do to reflect on it
    - Give prediction before doing something
    - Some limitations on phone? (Not sure I need)
</TODO>

<Goal>
- Better spent time in regards to the greater goals; less small compounding distractions.
- ...
</Goal>

#### Logging everything I do to reflect on it

<Callout variant="question" title="How to do it properly?">
    Still have to figure out what's the best way to log everything easily. I have 2 ideas in mind:
    - Either aggregate data from different sources (phone, computer, wakatime, kindle, etc.) but we need to find a way to extract the data easily.
    - Alternatively, I actively log everything in a well-structured manner and develop the habit to do so.
</Callout>

It seems very important to have some data on how I spend my time to be able to reflect on it and improve. I don't need a very fine grained detail of what I do but at least the big categories and how they're linked to the greater goals (sport, reading, writing, social medias, ...)

#### Getting better at predictions

Once I determine precisely how my time is allocated, a natural way to accomplish more in a day is to predict how long a certain task will take. Coupled with the previous section, this allows me to have an overview of my day and be quite accurate about what I can achieve in a day, a week, ...

#### Hard constraints?

<Callout variant="question">
Do I need hard constraints on my time allocation/management?
</Callout>

### 4. Social

<TODO>
    - Participate to all the events possible
    - Call people
    - Cold messaging
    - Online presence
</TODO>

<Goal>
- More visibility and bigger network that will help in general [@Shirado2019]
- ...
</Goal>

## Short term plan

Based on the long term goals, I'll setup a daily, weekly and monthly habit based plan.


| Name                        | Category                  | Notes                                                                 | Frequency  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Read **1** book per month | <CategoryBadge category={"brain"} />                       | with at least 10 minutes a day | monthly |
| Write **2** blog post per month | <CategoryBadge category={"social"} />                       | | monthly |
| Write **2** notes per week | <CategoryBadge category={"social"} />                       | | weekly |
| Do **3h** of sport per week | <CategoryBadge category={"health"} />                       | with at least 25% in high intensity (>150bpm) | weekly |

**â†’ Will start this plan on September 1, 2025**
