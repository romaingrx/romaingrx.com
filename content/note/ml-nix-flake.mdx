Setting up a machine learning environment with proper CUDA support can be a frustrating experience. Dependency conflicts, version mismatches, and driver compatibility issues often turn what should be a simple setup into hours of troubleshooting. This is where Nix Flakes come to the rescue.

Here's the complete Nix flake that solves these problems:

```nix
{
  description = "dev shell with uv and cuda out of the box";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.11";
    nix-gl-host.url = "github:numtide/nix-gl-host";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nix-gl-host }:
    let
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        config.allowUnfree = true;
        config.cudaSupport = true;
      };
    in
    {
      devShells.x86_64-linux.default = with pkgs; mkShell rec {

        packages = [
          cmake
          ninja
          cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
          cudaPackages.cuda_cudart
          cudaPackages.cuda_cupti
          cudaPackages.cuda_nvrtc
          cudaPackages.cuda_nvtx
          cudaPackages.cudnn
          cudaPackages.libcublas
          cudaPackages.libcufft
          cudaPackages.libcurand
          cudaPackages.libcusolver
          cudaPackages.libcusparse
          cudaPackages.libnvjitlink
          cudaPackages.nccl
          nix-gl-host.defaultPackage.x86_64-linux
          uv
          python312
          zlib
        ];

        shellHook = ''
          if [ ! -f pyproject.toml ]; then
            uv sync
            . .venv/bin/activate
          fi
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(nixglhost -p):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${lib.makeLibraryPath packages}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${stdenv.cc.cc.lib}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
        '';
      };
    };
}
```

This flake creates a development environment with everything you need for machine learning with CUDA support. Let's break down what it does:

1. It uses the stable Nixpkgs channel (24.11) and the nix-gl-host package for OpenGL/CUDA compatibility
2. It enables unfree packages and CUDA support in the configuration
3. It includes a comprehensive set of CUDA libraries and tools (cudatoolkit, cudnn, etc.)
4. It provides Python 3.12 with the uv package manager for fast dependency management
5. The shell hook automatically sets up a Python virtual environment and configures all the necessary library paths

The beauty of this flake is its simplicity - with just one command, you get a fully configured environment that would normally take hours to set up manually.

## What is this Flake?

This Nix Flake provides a ready-to-use development environment for machine learning projects with:

- CUDA toolkit and libraries pre-configured
- Python 3.12 with uv package manager
- Automatic virtual environment setup
- Proper library path configuration

## Key Benefits

1. **Reproducible environments** - Same setup works consistently across machines
2. **Zero configuration CUDA** - All CUDA libraries and paths set up automatically
3. **Modern Python tooling** - Uses uv for faster dependency management
4. **Declarative approach** - Environment defined as code, easy to modify

## Getting Started

Using this flake is incredibly simple, just run:

```bash
nix develop --no-write-lock-file github:romaingrx/ml-nix-flake
```

or copy the flake to your project and run:

```bash
nix develop
```

That's it! You now have a fully configured ML environment with CUDA support.

## Understanding the Flake

Let's examine the key components of the flake in more detail:

### Inputs

The flake has two main inputs:

- `nixpkgs` - Points to the stable Nixos-24.11 channel for consistent package versions
- `nix-gl-host` - A utility that helps with OpenGL/CUDA compatibility across different environments

### Configuration

The configuration enables:

- `allowUnfree = true` - Required for CUDA packages which are not open source
- `cudaSupport = true` - Ensures packages are built with CUDA support where applicable

### CUDA Packages

The flake includes a comprehensive set of CUDA libraries:

- Core CUDA toolkit and runtime libraries
- cuDNN for deep learning acceleration
- Math libraries (cuBLAS, cuFFT, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE)
- NCCL for multi-GPU communication
- Various CUDA utilities and development tools

### Python Environment

The Python setup includes:

- Python 3.12 - A modern Python version
- uv - A fast, reliable Python package installer and resolver
- Automatic virtual environment creation and activation

### Shell Hook

The shell hook performs three critical functions:

1. Creates and activates a Python virtual environment if one doesn't exist
2. Sets up the OpenGL library path using nixglhost
3. Configures the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include all necessary CUDA libraries

This careful configuration of library paths is what makes the CUDA setup work seamlessly without manual intervention.

## Customizing for Your Project

To adapt this flake for your specific ML project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify the `packages` list to add or remove dependencies
3. Adjust the Python version if needed
4. Add project-specific setup to the `shellHook`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and drivers installed
- Check that virtualization features are enabled if using in a container
- Verify that your system architecture matches (x86_64-linux)
- Be aware that existing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` settings in your environment might interfere with the flake's configuration. If you experience library-related errors, try starting with a clean environment or temporarily unset conflicting paths.

By using this Nix Flake, you can focus on your machine learning work rather than fighting with environment setup.
