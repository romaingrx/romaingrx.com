<TODO>

- Explain the areas of improvements, what I mean exactly
- Make the long term plan based on these areas
- Make the short term plan generic
- Make the current short term plan specific

</TODO>

I currently feel that I'm not the most effective at getting things done, consistently getting better at what I want and care about so I'd like to make a plan to methodically improve with 2 horizons/frequencies:
- *short term* / *high frequency*: A plan based on daily, weekly an monthly base habits; easy to assess how well I execute it.
- *long term* / *low frequency*: Long term goals that will dictate the direction to readjust the *high frequency* plan.


The goal is to have a support that doesn't take too much brain power, is easy to follow, assess and readjust as I go.

## Areas of improvement

I would like to improve in the following areas:

0. Raw skills
1. Brain clarity / problem solving
2. Health
3. Social life
4. Time management
