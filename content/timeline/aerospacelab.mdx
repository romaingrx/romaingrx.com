Developed and deployed a production-ready computer vision system for satellite image analysis.

Key achievements:

- Implemented a Mask-RCNN model for:
  - Object detection in satellite imagery
  - Precise segmentation of detected objects
  - Area computation of segmented regions
- Integrated the model with OpenStreetMap data for location-based image matching
- Successfully deployed the model to production environment
- Model is currently being used in production for satellite image analysis
